# Automation-Scripts

This repository contains a collection of automation scripts that I've created to help automate various tasks. I'll be adding new scripts to this repository from time to time, so be sure to check back regularly!

Each script has its own README file with instructions on how to use it. Simply navigate to the script you're interested in and follow the instructions.

## Contributing
